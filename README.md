# ASSIGNMENT: CH 3 Portfolio
# This program is a digital portfolio for this assignment

# List of files in the repository:
# - portfolio.py
# - MY_DATA.md
# - README.md

# The program can be run through GitHub
# Key features of my program is the portfolio database used to store college life information 

# I learned a lot from this assignment! It was quite challenging because I've never used Git but It wasn't too hard. I enjoyed getting to code for real for the first time.

# AI used to correct final corrections in all the end state. I used GitHub AI to discover exactly where I went wrong in my code as a learning tool.

# Assignment 3: Personal Data Portfolio & Git Collaboration
